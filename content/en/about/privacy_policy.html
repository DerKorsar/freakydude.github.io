<p>Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for
    the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered
    there.</p>
<p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as
    the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization,
    structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
    dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction
    performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
<p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and
    legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also
    inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience
    which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>
<p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
<p>I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br>II. The rights of users and data subjects<br>III. Information
    about the data processing</p>
<h3>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>

<p>The controller's data protection officer is:</p>
<p><span>Frank Roth&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
<p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed,
        further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
    </li>
    <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
    <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further
        processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
    </li>
    <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other
        providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
    <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed
        by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections,
    deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation
    does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a
    right to information about these recipients.</p>
<p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future
        processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing
        for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
<h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
<p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases
    to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless
    otherwise stipulated below.</p>
<h4>Server data</h4>
<p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be
    collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of
    your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited,
    the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.</p>
<p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>
<p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement,
    stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>
<p>The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary
    purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the
    relevant incident is finally resolved.</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<h5>a) Session cookies</h5>
<p>We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by
    your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or
    IP address. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display our
    website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.</p>
<p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect data
    to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p>
<p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the
    functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p>
<p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>
<h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>
<p>If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising,
    analyzing, or improving the features of our website.</p>
<p>Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose of such
    third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.</p>
<h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
<p>You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to
    delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the
    browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your
    browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being set.
    Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also
    depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the
    documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.</p>
<p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully usable.</p>
<h4>User posts, comments, and ratings</h4>
<p>We offer you the opportunity to post questions, answers, opinions, and ratings on our website, hereinafter referred
    to jointly as "posts." If you make use of this opportunity, we will process and publish your post, the date and time
    you submitted it, and any pseudonym you may have used.</p>
<p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR
    with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.</p>
<p>In addition, we will also process your IP address and email address. The IP address is processed because we might
    have a legitimate interest in taking or supporting further action if your post infringes the rights of third parties
    and/or is otherwise unlawful.</p>
<p>In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in any legal defense we
    may have to mount.</p>

<p>If you make posts on our website, we also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to any subsequent follow-up comments
    made by third parties. In order to be able to inform you about these follow-up comments, we will need to process
    your email address.</p>

    Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent or click
    on the unsubscribe link contained in each email.</p>
<h4>Social media links via graphics</h4>
<p>We also integrate the following social media sites into our website. The integration takes place via a linked graphic
    of the respective site. The use of these graphics stored on our own servers prevents the automatic connection to the
    servers of these networks for their display. Only by clicking on the corresponding graphic will you be forwarded to
    the service of the respective social network.</p>
<p>Once you click, that network may record information about you and your visit to our site. It cannot be ruled out that
    such data will be processed in the United States.</p>
<p>Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the date and time of your visit, and the page visited.
    If you are logged into your user account on that network, however, the network operator might assign the information
    collected about your visit to our site to your personal account. If you interact by clicking Like, Share, etc., this
    information can be stored your personal user account and possibly posted on the respective network. To prevent this,
    you need to log out of your social media account before clicking on the graphic. The various social media networks
    also offer settings that you can configure accordingly.</p>
