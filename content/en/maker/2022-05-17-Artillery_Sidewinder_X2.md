## Intro

I bought my first 3D printer. Yes, I finally did it. I have chosen an **Artillery Sidewinder X2**. The following article tells you, why i think it's a big deal.

## Pros and Cons

Because in my opinion the Artillery Sidewinder X2 is a really smart choice at the time of writing if you don't want to spend exorbitary money and have some wishes like a 300x300x400mm printable volume, an direct extruder, auto bed leveling, an included color-touch-display and a filament sensor. On top, its a really silent printer and the heat-bed is not only ultra fast heated up, the 110/220V heat-bed voltage needs no big power supply and so the installed small one needs only a semi-passiv silent fan. Great selection.
