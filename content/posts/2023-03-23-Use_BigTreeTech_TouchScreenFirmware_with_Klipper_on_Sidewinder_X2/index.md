## Intro

If you followed my last posts, you know I switched from Marlin to Klipper firmware on my Artillery Sidewinder X2. If you did the same, you maybe run in the same issue like me.

My integrated Display is useless!

But I found a solution - well - not perfect yet but more then OK for my main use cases. After a lot of reading though discussions I understood the relationships between the printers Mainboard, the included TFT, Marlin and Klipper and got an idea.

So I started an experiment, which I think was successful. It results into a open source project which in itself is an experiment again.

Sooo what I'am talking about?!

## Conclusion

For further steps and more details it is always a very good idea to walk through the very good official documentations

- [Klipper Documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html)
- [Mainsail Documentation](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/)

Please leave comments, if something is wrong or missing. Or if you have questions.

Enjoy!
