## Intro

Klipper has the powerful possibilty to add G-Code macros or even overwrite existing G-Codes. Klipper knows only about standard G-Codes ([Descripted in Klipper documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/G-Codes.html)) by default. You have to configure everything that goes beyond. Szenarios are filament runout, pause and resume print, filament change, cancel objects etc. In case of the Artillery Sidewinder X2, you can also add some macros what should happen with the neopixel LED on your extruder. 

The basic idea is often not mine. Instead, I have gathered examples from documentation and adapted them to the Sidewinder X2 and my needs.

## Macros

### Start and stop print

### Pause and resume print

### Filament runout

### Filament change

### LED on/off, LED color on temp

### Conclusion
